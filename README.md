(Project still in development)

The Kupe Clone is a Reacy project built with Gatsby based on the Kupe Data Explorer made by Epi-interactive and Health Promotion Agency (HPA). The original app was made with R Shiny web framework to visualise the data in various topics from the Health and Lifestyles Survey. The aim of this project is to improve on the existing app with a few things in mind: 

*  User experience
*  User interface features not possible in Shiny
*  Speed 
*  SEO

## New features for Kupe

*  Page-by-page routing - each Topic, Subtopic, and Indicator has it's own URL to improve SEO and sharability.
*  Megamenu - banner-style expanding menu lets users see all the Topics, Subtopics, and Indicators in one place in all the pages, which are all linked for easy access.
*  Search - Search for a key term to filter through Topics, Subtopics, and Indicators at anywhere in the app.
*  Animations - Animations have been added wherever possible (but hopefully not exhaustively)
*  Static assets - Built on Gatsby, each site is statically generated which makes page loads significantly faster. 
*  PWA - You can install Kupe now to your phone, tablet, or computer for easy access and even access it's data offline.
